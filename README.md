# Click Through Prediction
## Will they click our ad?

## Project Description
In online advertising, click-through rate (CTR) is a very important metric for evaluating ad performance. In this project I will try to predict if someone will click-through based on information provided from the website.

## Project Goals
* Identify key features that can be used to create an effective predictive model.
* Use classification models to make click-through predictions.
* Use findings to make recommendations and establish a foundation for future work to improve model's performance.

## Initial Thoughts

My initial hypothesis is that those who are browsing the website in the middle of the night are more likely to click the advertisement.

## The Plan
* Aqcuire the data from [here] (https://github.com/interviewquery/takehomes/tree/oreilly_1/oreilly_1)

* Prepare data
    * Checked for nulls, there were none
    * Changed the ```hour``` column to datetime
    * Data was already split in to train and test, I further split the train into a validate set.

* Explore data in search of drivers of churn
    * Answer the following initial question
        * What percentage of instances result in a click-through?
        * Does hour of the day have a relationship with clicks?
        * Does day of the week have a relationship with clicks?
        * Does banner position have a relationship with clicks?
        * 

* Develop a model to predict the value of a house
    * Use drivers identified through exploration to build different predictive models
    * Evaluate models on train and validate data
    * Select best model based on highest accuracy
    * Evaluate the best model on the test data

* Draw conclusions
